Write a function for them in R that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit so that they can stop bothering you to do the conversion for them. Note that last week you converted F to C and this week is the opposite! 1A. In a code chunk, convert 22Â°C into Fahrenheit. Feel free to Google the formula. Also, note that you may want to be careful to use parentheses to make sure the order of operations is correct.

### Using the argument function, writing a code that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit. 

###### The code needs to start with x\*(9/5)+32.  In this line of code, the code is going to concert 22 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.

```{r Q1a}
22*(9/5)+32

```

###### The next step is to assign the value you are converting to an object.  Once that has been written, use the object name and insert the formula.

```{r setup, Q 1b}
C_temp<- 22
C_temp*(9/5)+32

 
```

###### Now define the function and create a scripted formula. 

```{r Q1c}
temp_conv<- function(celsius){
  
  math<-celsius*(9/5)+32
  return(math)
  
  
}
```

###### Below you will find examples of how to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 

```{r Q1D}

temp_conv(5)
temp_conv(35)

```
